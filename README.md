## Code Overview

The EA Black Scorpion MT5 code is designed to identify high price fluctuations in the market and open pending orders at opportune moments. The code consists of several functions that are explained below:

### Expert Initialization Function (OnInit)

The OnInit function is executed during the initialization of the expert advisor. It is responsible for initializing necessary variables and indicators. Any required setup and configuration can be performed in this function.

### Expert Deinitialization Function (OnDeinit)

The OnDeinit function is executed when the expert advisor is being deinitialized. It is responsible for performing necessary cleanup and closing any open orders. Any required actions to be taken before the EA is stopped should be implemented in this function.

### Expert Tick Function (OnTick)

The OnTick function is executed on every tick of the market. It is responsible for performing the complex mathematical calculation system to identify high price fluctuations on the chart. It checks if there are good moments to enter the market by calling the CheckGoodMoments function. If there are good moments, it opens BuyStop and SellStop pending orders by calling the OpenPendingOrders function.

### Check Good Moments Function (CheckGoodMoments)

The CheckGoodMoments function implements the logic to determine if there are good moments to enter the market. This function should be customized according to the specific trading strategy and conditions.

### Open Pending Orders Function (OpenPendingOrders)

The OpenPendingOrders function implements the logic to open BuyStop and SellStop pending orders. The specific rules and conditions for placing the pending orders should be implemented in this function.

### Expert Start Function (OnStart)

The OnStart function is executed when the expert advisor starts trading. It sets the advisor to conduct trading on the H1 timeframe by using the ChartSetInteger function. It also implements risk management strategies to ensure that the EA does not use risky strategies. The trading loop is started using a while loop, where the OnTick function is called and the EA sleeps for 1 second between each tick.
